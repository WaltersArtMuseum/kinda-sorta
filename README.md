# kinda-sorta
user defined recommender for museum objects 


# Why? 
Many museums provide some mechanism for users to see 'related' objects from an object page. These are valuable because they allow users to click through and explore the collection further. However, these approaches has several limitations which kinda-sorta seeks to solve. 

Issues with existing approaches
--------------------------------
1. They are one-dimensional. The Walters provides several ways to explore objects which have in common a single data point (creator, medium, geography, location)
2. They don't reflect *my* values
3. They are a black box
4. They are static **

Improvements from kinda-sorta
------------------------------
1. Multi-dimensional 
2. Reflect my values
3. More transparent
4. Dynamic 
5. Aggregate
